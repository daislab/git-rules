## Creating a new ISSUE

## Steps:

1. Create a branch -- associate with an issue

2. In-branch commits


3. Passing updates to main

 -  3.1 Clean commits


 -  3.2 combine to main


 -  3.3 Remove branch

 Once the issue is closed and the changes have been passed to the main branch you can delete the branch. 
 First, delete the branch locally using the following command:

 > git branch -d \<branch-name\>

Then push this action to remote repository:

> git push origin -d \<branch-name\>
